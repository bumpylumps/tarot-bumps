# Tarot Bumps
I built this app to give people easy and free access to digital Tarot card readings. It is in it's early stages, so 
right now TarotBumps is a basic API. But there will be more functionality added in the future!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js

I've generated a server with Express that also holds it's api's and a database of Tarot cards. There is also some basic HTML for the index, and some CSS on the way. Eventually I will build out a client side site to consume this API with, with the ability to ask for Tarot pulls and full Tarot spreads (like the Celtic Cross). 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I would like to optimize the functionality that this API is capable of by adding pictures of cards from my deck, breakdowns of the symbols in each card, and brief descriptions of possible divination messages for each card. There will also be options for different types of pulls, and an encyclopedia to peruse the deck with. May also add some more divination practices in the future (for example Oracle cards, I ching, etc.)

## Lessons Learned:

So far I've used this project to learn how to get servers hosted online with Heroku. I also learned how servers communicate with client side pages and how to customize API requests.Tarot Bumps has also taught me how to populate servers! It's made me feel extremely powerful. 

## Examples:
I will provide examples once the site is built out a bit more.
