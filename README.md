# Tarot Bumps
I built this app to give people easy and free access to digital Tarot card readings. It is in it's early stages, so 
right now TarotBumps is a basic API. But there will be more functionality added in the future!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML/EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB

I've built a server using Node and Express. There is also some basic HTML for the index, and some CSS on the way.  

## Optimizations

I would like to optimize the functionality that this API is capable of by adding pictures of cards from my deck, breakdowns of the symbols in each card, and brief descriptions of possible divination messages for each card. There will also be options for different types of pulls, and an encyclopedia to peruse the deck with. May also add some more divination practices in the future (for example Oracle cards, I ching, etc.)

## Lessons Learned:

So far I've used this project to learn CRUD basics, building databases and pulling info from them. I also learned how servers communicate with client side pages and how to customize API requests.Tarot Bumps has also taught me how to implement EJS and pull data from MongoDB clusters! It's made me feel extremely powerful.

## Examples:
Pages are now dynamic and implement EJS templates and Express. They are also being served through a server.
